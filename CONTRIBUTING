# Contributing Guidelines

Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed
and highly encouraged!

# Development

The latest openapi spec can be found at
https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi

# Documentation

When updating the openapi spec in the `share` directory, be sure to run
`devel/build_docs.pl` to update the documentation.

If you prefer, you can run the `bash` script, `devel/rebuild` to cleanly
rebuild the project after changes are made. See `devel/rebuild -h` for more
information.

# Examples

Please continue to add examples to the `examples/` directory. After running
`devel/build_docs.pl`, any example added there will automatically be linked in
the documentation at `lib/OpenAPI/Client/OpenAI/Methods.pod`.
