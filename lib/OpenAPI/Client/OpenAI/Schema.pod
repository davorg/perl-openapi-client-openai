=head1 NAME

OpenAPI::Client::OpenAI::Schema - OpenAI API client Schema

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains the schema for the OpenAI API client. To aid in
comprehension, the schema has all references resolved. This makes this schema
much larger than the original OpenAPI schema.

                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
    
                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
                  **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

        AssistantStreamEvent:
          description: |
            Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.
    
            Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:
    
            ```
            event: thread.created
            data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
            ```
    
            We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
            streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
            is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
            to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
            `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
            `thread.message.completed` event.
    
            We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
            in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
            integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

                          Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
    
                          Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
                          **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

            Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
            **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

            Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
            `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
            `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
            `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
            Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
    
                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
                  **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

                **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model
                to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the
                model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation
                reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck"
                request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if
                `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded
                `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
    
                As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
    
                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
                  **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

                  `none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
                  `auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
                  `required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
                  Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
    
                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
                  **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
    
                  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.
    
                  **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

            Once you complete the Upload, we will create a [File](/docs/api-reference/files/object) object that contains all the parts you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular File object.
    
            For certain `purpose`s, the correct `mime_type` must be specified. Please refer to documentation for the supported MIME types for your use case:
            - [Assistants](/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files)
    
            For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please follow the documentation on [creating a File](/docs/api-reference/files/create).
